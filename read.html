            <p>In today’s Newsroom, we unpack why India ranks at the very top of one global happiness survey and near the bottom of another. And why happiness, like many things in life, depends on when, how, and whom you ask.</p>

            <p>But here’s a quick heads up before we dive in. This story briefly mentions India’s youth suicide rates while discussing happiness surveys. If you’re feeling vulnerable or need support, please consider reaching out to someone you trust or a mental health professional. You can also find suicide prevention helpline contacts here.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>The Story</h3>

            <p>A few weeks ago, Ipsos, a global market research firm, put up a survey called Happiness Index 2025. And sitting right at the top of the 30-country chart, above the Netherlands, above Brazil, above Indonesia, was India.</p>

            <p>Yup. India. 88% of Indians surveyed said they were happy. Either “very” or “rather” happy.</p>

            
            <p>Now, that’s one heck of a headline, isn’t it?</p>

            <p>Until… you glance at the World Happiness Report — the one that asks people to evaluate their lives on a scale from 0 to 10 over 2022–2024. In that ranking? India ranks 118 out of 147 countries. Behind nations in conflict. Behind countries with double digit inflation. Behind places where democracy is more fragile than stable.</p>

            <p>So… how is it possible that we’re both the world’s happiest and one of its most miserable?</p>

            <p>Well, no single survey can capture an entire nation’s mood, but the contrast here offers insight into how Indians think and feel about happiness itself.</p>

            <p>Let’s start with a few numbers. Ipsos surveyed 23,765 adults, while the World Happiness Report uses Gallup World Poll data from over 1 lakh people across 140 countries, with around 1,000 per country. So there’s a wide difference in the sample size.</p>

            <p>Then the two reports don’t even ask the same questions.</p>

            <p>Ipsos asks a simple question: “Taking all things together, would you say you are: very happy, rather happy, not very happy, not happy at all?” That’s it. No scale, no scores, no deep reflection.</p>

            <p>The Gallup poll, on the other hand, asks you to picture a ladder…</p>

            <p class="right-border">Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?</p>

            <p>Plus, the poll includes over 100 global and region-specific questions. So it’s less about how you feel in the moment and more about how you evaluate your life as a whole. And that shift in framing changes things.</p>

            <p>Then there’s the difference that the Ipsos survey is done online, mostly in urban areas. Of the 2,200 Indians surveyed, just 400 were interviewed online. But even then, the sample skews middle class.</p>

            <p>The Gallup survey, on the other hand, is conducted face-to-face or over the phone, covering both rural and urban India, across income levels and regions.</p>

            <p>So, when you ask a city-dweller, “Are you happy?”, you might hear a cheerful “Yeah, not bad.” But ask someone in rural India to rate their life on a 10-point scale — someone who might be walking kilometres to get a few things done or hasn’t had steady work in months, and the answer is bound to feel heavier.</p>

            <p>In short, these surveys are capturing different Indias. One shows how we feel. The other shows how we live.</p>

            <p>And then comes the timing of these surveys.</p>

            <p>Take Japan, for instance. This year, it ranked among the least happy countries in the Ipsos survey, with only 60% saying they were very or rather happy. And that’s way less than the 70% figure the nation saw in 2011. So why the sudden drop? Well, for years, Japan grappled with deflation (a period where prices were stagnant or falling). But now, inflation is back and wages haven’t kept pace, so people feel the pinch. And that shows up in their happiness score.</p>

            <p>But hold on, Newsroom. Isn’t India also facing inflation? So why aren’t we sulking in the surveys? Well, we are; just not in all of them.</p>

            <p>In the World Happiness Report, India’s average life satisfaction score is 4 out of 10. And other happiness indexes echo the same contradiction. The OECD’s Better Life Index doesn’t even include India. Why? Because there isn’t enough consistent data to compare. It tracks 11 indicators like housing, jobs, safety, education and life satisfaction, but India doesn’t make the cut.</p>

            <p>Then there’s Gallup’s Global Emotions map, which shows an equally mixed picture. Indians report high levels of enjoyment, pride and love — but also high levels of stress, worry and sadness.</p>

            <p>So maybe this isn’t a paradox. Maybe we’re just… complicated?</p>

            <p>Because while things are far from perfect, some indicators are coming off a different curve. Growth is up, poverty is declining, and consumer confidence is recovering. So ask people how they feel right now, and they might say: “Better than before.”</p>

            <p>But that doesn’t mean we’ve solved the underlying problems. Because here’s the thing. Happiness is not just a feeling, it’s a frame. It’s shaped by memory, context and expectations.</p>

            <p>And in India, a lot of that happiness may come from our emotional infrastructure.</p>

            <p>As Ipsos puts it:</p>

            <p class="right-border">India's happiness might stem from its strong social fabric. Close-knit families, community support, and deep-rooted spiritual beliefs likely play a significant role. These factors provide a sense of belonging, purpose, and resilience, even in the face of adversity.</p>

            <p>These bonds help people get by emotionally, if not always financially.</p>

            <p>But even these buffers have their limits. Because when Indians are unhappy, they say one thing loud and clear: “My financial situation.” And this is where all surveys — Ipsos and other reports, agree. Money is the top pain point.</p>

            <p>So yeah, on paper, India’s GDP per capita has doubled since 2015. But the live reality doesn’t match the headline.</p>

            <p>The richest 1% holds over 40% of the country’s wealth. India ranks 96th in global corruption perception, and near the bottom on free speech and safety rankings.</p>

            <p>So even if GDP is booming, the average Indian doesn’t always feel richer, safer or more secure.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the real question is ‘What do we even mean by happiness?’</p>

            <p>If it’s about money, opportunity and safety, India’s low ranking in other reports makes sense. But if it’s about love, family, resilience and hope, the Ipsos 88% checks out too.</p>

            <p>So maybe the paradox isn’t the real story, it’s the gap between our emotional strength and economic reality.</p>

            <p>We cheer billion dollar IPOs, while 13 crore Indians earn less than ₹200 a day. We build the tallest statues, but have the highest youth suicide rates. We say we’re happy, and in many ways, we are. But until our wallets, wages and well-being move in sync… we’ll keep topping some charts… and tanking others. At the same time. What do you think?</p>

            <p>Until then…</p>

          <h3>The story</h3>

          <p>Kirana stores, those small, familiar shops that once ruled the Indian grocery market, are now facing an existential crisis. And no prizes for guessing who’s the culprit — quick commerce platforms like Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Zepto, which promise to deliver groceries or almost everything under the sun in just 10 to 30 minutes after you think of them.</p>

          <p>As it turns out, nearly 80% of consumers have shifted at least a quarter of their grocery spending from kiranas to these lightning-fast delivery apps.</p>

          <p>The impact?</p>

          <p>In just the past year, over 2 lakh kirana stores have shut shop.</p>

          <p>At first glance, it looks like quick commerce has completely cannibalised kirana sales and as if these neighbourhood stores are a dying breed. And while that’s partly true, there’s a case to be made for why quick commerce won’t be able to wipe them out entirely.</p>

          <p>Now, if you’re wondering why we’re bringing this up today, it’s because a couple of days ago, a parliamentary standing committee directed the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to explain what it’s doing to protect small retailers. This comes amid growing allegations of deep discounts and unfair trade practices by some of the big e-commerce players in the market.</p>

          <p>So while that’s in progress, we thought it’d be a good time to dig deeper into what’s really going on.</p>

          <p>To begin with, you have to understand why kirana stores are losing business. And honestly, the answer’s pretty straightforward.</p>

          <p>The shopping experience at unorganised retail is broken. If you’ve ever stepped into most small kirana stores, you’ll know what that means. You can’t just stroll in and pick what you want. Anything that lets you do that is called a supermarket. And since kiranas and other unorganised retail stores still make up nearly three fourths of India’s retail market, it means a large chunk of customers are used to this limiting experience. But when platforms let you pick, click and get your groceries delivered in minutes, it’s hard not to be tempted.</p>

          <p>Sure, a kirana might be just across the street or a few blocks away. But sometimes you’ll have to deal with a grumpy shopkeeper, or hop between stores looking for the brand you want. Online or supermarket shopping simply makes that easier.</p>

          <p>Compare that to mature markets like the US, where quick commerce never really took off and you’ll be able to get a better sense of what we’re saying. These platforms were barely able to make a dent there because retail is dominated by organised players, offering a better shopping experience right from the start. Plus, Americans don’t mind driving nearly 4 miles (around 6 km), which is the average commute for groceries, because almost every adult has a car, and paying for fuel isn’t a big deal. So quick commerce didn’t really have a problem to solve there, but it does in India.</p>

          <p>The second important thing is that there’s no level playing field. See, when a retailer gives you a discount, it’s usually because they’re buying products cheaper in bulk and keeping their profit margins low. For a kirana store, that margin is about 5–10%, maybe 15% if they’re lucky.</p>

          <p>But quick commerce platforms have got an unfailing weapon — offers! They’re happy to lose money for now, just to reel people in and make sure convenience becomes second nature.</p>

          <p>Remember how apps like Google Pay, PhonePe and Paytm used to flood us with cashback offers? Slowly, those made way for brand or merchant based coupons and then came convenience fees on bill payments and mobile recharges. Yet, by then we were hooked. No more visiting the neighbourhood recharge chap or standing in long queues at the electricity office to pay the bill. Food delivery apps followed a similar playbook. Swiggy and Zomato, for instance, reeled us in with deep discounts before slowly dialling them down.</p>

          <p>And quick commerce is playing a similar game. And the reason they can afford those heavy discounts and offers is because of foreign venture capital (VC) money. It might seem like a harmless boost, but it actually creates an uneven playing field.</p>

          <p>That’s because foreign VC money is basically FDI (foreign direct investment). Now, India does allow foreign investors to own up to 51% in multi-brand retail businesses (or stores that sell products from multiple brands under one roof). But this needs government approval and comes with strict conditions. More importantly, FDI-backed e-commerce marketplaces aren’t supposed to own or control inventory. They can invest in platforms that act as intermediaries, but they can’t directly hold stock. The idea is to stop giant multinationals from flooding the market and pushing small local stores out of business.</p>

          <p>But according to a white paper by CAIT (Confederation of All India Traders), quick commerce companies have found a clever way to break these rules — dark stores. Yup, those small hidden warehouses peppered across delivery areas that make those 10-minute delivery promises possible. CAIT believes these platforms are essentially running multi-brand retail operations because they sell products from different brands directly to customers. To dodge the FDI restrictions, they set up dark stores and create a network of preferred sellers. These sellers get lower fees for warehousing, delivery and other services, giving the platform indirect control over inventory.</p>

          <p>CAIT’s proof to back this claim is that only about 2–5% of foreign funds is reportedly going towards actual infrastructure. The rest gets used to cover losses, offer steep discounts, subsidise warehouses, inventory and logistics.</p>

          <p>In other words, quick commerce may not exactly be playing fair, while stealing business away from the humble kirana store.</p>

          <p>But here’s the thing. This VC money may not be able to completely wipe out India’s kirana stores so easily. For one, the CCI is already investigating these alleged unfair practices. Plus, the government isn’t going to increase that 51% FDI cap in multi-brand retail any time soon.</p>

          <p>And then there’s something else — where these kirana stores are shutting down. Most of the 2 lakh closures we mentioned earlier or 45% came from metro cities. Tier 1 cities made up 30% and Tier 2 and 3 cities saw 25%.</p>

          <p>In smaller towns and rural areas though, it’s a different story. People are fiercely loyal to their neighbourhood kirana store. I live in a small town myself, and when a More supermarket opened just across the street, I was excited. But my mother in law immediately said, “If we all start flocking to these big billionaire-owned stores, what happens to our kirana shops who’ve worked for years to serve us?” That sense of community runs deep outside the metros.</p>

          <p>Plus, kiranas still offer goods on credit, something people rely on for monthly groceries in many parts of the country. And navigating online shopping isn’t exactly second nature for everyone there either.</p>

          <p>Even big brands recognise this. Companies like Parle are launching exclusive small packs only for kirana stores. And for quick commerce, which works best with ₹500–700 order values, those impulse-sized packs don’t always make sense.</p>

          <p>And here’s a thought. Why compete when you can collaborate? Quick commerce platforms could tie up with kirana stores instead of setting up dark stores, using their inventory for deliveries. Flipkart Minutes is already doing this and making lightning-fast deliveries without cutting them out of the game.</p>

          <p>So yeah, quick commerce might be sprinting ahead, but kirana stores are the ‘cockroaches’ of the business world — profit-driven survivors built to thrive in tough times. They’ve seen licence raj, modern retail and even demonetisation. They might be down, but they’re definitely not out.</p>

          <p>Until next time…</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>The story</h3>

            <p>50%!</p>

            <p>That’s the number analysts say India could eventually meet in supplying the world's iPhones. And that’s a big leap from 2017, when India barely featured in Apple’s global production map.</p>

            <p>To understand this shift, let’s take it from the top.</p>

            <p>When trade wars heat up, Apple could just bring iPhone production to the US. But it’s not that simple. Because iPhone's an assembled gadget with components from over 40 countries. And to piece that together, Apple needs a colossal workforce of trained hands and a network of specialized suppliers. But the US doesn’t have that scale. It lacks the labour. Rebuilding the entire supply chain in the US would take years and cost billions. Plus, it certainly doesn’t have the cost advantage. As per an estimate, an iPhone made in the US could cost 5x more than it would in China. And that’s perhaps the reason why Apple makes 80% of its products in China today.</p>

            <p>But with the tariff war, Apple’s looking for a different plan. And India fits the bill. iPhone exports from India to the US are said to be about 20% cheaper than from China after the tariff changes. India also has a vast labour pool and a growing local market for iPhones. And Apple has cracked the Indian market before.</p>

            <p>Today, 20% of its global iPhone output comes from India. Foxconn, Apple’s long-time manufacturing muscle, now runs mega assembling factories and has plans of expansion. Tata Electronics has taken over Wistron’s and Pegatron’s facilities to become major iPhone supplier.</p>

            <p>And that makes us ask - Can India really become the next China?</p>

            <p>Well, making iPhones is one thing. Designing, innovating, and building the core components? That’s another game entirely.</p>

            <p>India’s innovation hasn’t picked up pace and we don’t control the high-end supply chains. Without owning more of this stack, India remains a spoke in Apple’s wheel. And the macro data reflects that. Private investment in India is just about 11% of GDP. R&D spending is stuck at a paltry 0.6% of GDP — far behind China’s 2.6%. Logistics still pose challenges, taxes remain high, policy flip-flops aren’t uncommon, and a steady stream of talent leaves the country every year.</p>

            <p>So the key is not just to assemble the iPhone, but to eventually own more of the value chain.</p>

            <p>And history shows us that trade conflicts can help countries do that. You see, back in the 1980s, Japan was eating into America’s dominance in cars, semiconductors, and electronics. So the US retaliated. First came the Voluntary Export Restraints on Japanese cars. Basically, Japan had to put a limit on the cars it exported to the US. Then the US and Japan signed the 1985 Plaza Accord — which made the yen dramatically stronger and its exports less competitive in the world. Japan responded by setting up more factories on US soil. And that allowed Japanese companies to maintain access to the US markets while addressing trade concerns.</p>

            <p>Apple’s playbook today looks similar. Diversify, de-risk, relocate. And do it fast.</p>

            <p>And it’s not just Apple. Globalisation as we know it is being rewritten. Startups are shipping globally from day one. Chinese sellers are bypassing retail chains and selling directly to US consumer at way lower prices on TikTok shops. Stablecoins are inching closer to becoming the unofficial currency of global trade. And countries are no longer building alliances just on price, but on politics too.</p>

            <p>So Apple’s India bet isn’t just about making cheaper phones. It’s also about staying prepared in a world where tariffs can shoot up without warning. And for India, it’s a chance to step up and start building the things the world wants.</p>

            <p>Most of us have already lived through a bunch of market meltdowns - the dotcom bust, the 2008 crisis, and Covid. Each time, the world order shifted. Just like the global trade is shifting today. And in the coming years, there's a good chance that most of the iPhones might say ‘Made in India.’</p>

            <p>Until then…</p>

          <p>In today’s Newsroom, we talk about STELLAR, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA)’s new tool to help electricity distributors manage power supply and possibly move towards zero power cuts in India.</p>

          <p>But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.</p>
    
          <hr>
    
          <h1>The Story</h1>
    
          <p>Over the last decade, India has been rushing to add a lot of solar and wind power to its electricity system. In theory, that sounds great. Clean, renewable energy is good for the planet.</p>
    
          <p>But here’s the problem. Most of these renewables don’t have proper storage systems like big batteries to save the extra energy generated during the day for use later. So, when the sun sets in the evening, especially during those hot summer months of May and June when people still need fans, ACs and lights, there’s a power shortage. Solar panels stop working, but the demand stays high.</p>
    
          <p>To make things worse (but better for the climate of course), India also slowed down building new thermal power plants — the coal plants that act as reliable, always-on sources to keep the grid stable when renewable supply drops.</p>
    
          
    
          <p>This means that without enough of these steady sources, the electricity grid becomes unstable, and power outages start becoming more frequent. For context, as of March 2024, India had an estimated total electricity generation capacity of about 520 GW — around 280 GW from coal or thermal energy, 198 GW from renewables and the rest from gas and nuclear. But in May 2024, India’s peak power demand hit 250 GW. That left very little breathing room or spare capacity for thermal plants to increase their plant load factor (PLF). That’s basically, how much of their maximum capacity is actually being used. These plants are already working hard, and there isn’t much extra capacity left to ramp up further when demand spikes.</p>
    
          
    
          <p>And this problem isn’t going away. India’s power consumption grew by 7% in 2023, compared to the global average of just 2%.</p>
    
          <p>So yeah, while the country plans to increase renewable energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030, if demand and supply don’t grow at the same pace, power cuts could become a regular thing. At least that’s what a research report from the India Energy and Climate Centre, University of California, says.</p>
    
          <p>But it seems as though India’s electricity authorities want to prove this theory wrong. Just a few days ago, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) launched a new indigenously built software tool called STELLAR. It’s basically a smart simulator for India’s electricity grid or a master planner for electricity generation, transmission, storage and demand management. It helps discoms (power distribution companies) figure out how much power they’ll need in the future, where it should come from, where to store it, and how to balance supply and demand without wasting money or causing blackouts.</p>
    
          <p>The best part? It’s being shared free of cost with all states and discoms, so everyone works off the same standard tool, improving planning and cutting unnecessary costs.</p>
    
          <p>Also, it ensures that discoms have sufficient power supply to meet demand without overcapacity, which the Ministry of Power’s guidelines from June 2023, warned against. Because when states overestimate their needs, it leads to idle capacity, unnecessary capital expenses and higher operational costs for discoms. Sure, this extra cost can be passed on to consumers through higher tariffs. But then, that’s not really something consumers will like, nor is it good for a state’s political environment, since power pricing in India is primarily regulated by the state.</p>
    
          <p>The smarter way is to find a balance. And that’s what STELLAR aims to do. It improves pricing efficiency by using real time data and forecasting, allowing for more accurate, cost reflective tariffs. Plus, by supporting dynamic pricing models like Time of Day (TOD) tariffs, it encourages people to shift their power use to cheaper, off-peak hours. If you’re new to TOD, here’s how it works. The day is divided into three parts — solar hours, peak hours and normal hours. Use more power during solar hours, pay less. Use it when demand spikes after sunset, pay more. That’s the idea.</p>
    
          <p>This can reduce pressure on the grid, lower system costs and cut down on the need for expensive backup options like diesel generators. And hopefully, prevent massive blackouts like the one in July 2012, when 620 million people or 9% of the world’s population at the time, were left in the dark.</p>
    
          <p>But does that mean that STELLAR can just magically fix India’s power supply problems?</p>
    
          <p>Well, maybe not. Because here’s the thing. While the tool itself is free for discoms, its benefits might still be limited. And that’s mainly due to the fact that Indian discoms aren’t exactly in the best of health.</p>
    
          <p>To put things into perspective, according to rating agency ICRA, the all India aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses, which basically means losses that happen due to inefficient transmission, distribution issues, theft or unpaid bills, dropped from 23% in FY21 to 16% in FY23, thanks to infrastructure upgrades and subsidies from state governments. These subsidies help discoms keep electricity affordable for certain consumers.</p>
    
          <p>Sounds like progress, right? But here’s the issue. Discoms in states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh are still struggling, sitting on losses, some even above 20%.</p>
    
          <p>And when discoms are already struggling financially, they might not be in a position to implement necessary changes or invest in complementary infrastructure to truly benefit from a tool like STELLAR even if it’s being handed to them for free. And if state governments delay those subsidies we mentioned earlier, discoms face cash flow problems, making matters worse. They might barely be able to cover operational expenses, let alone spend on optimising their systems with new tools.</p>
    
          <p>Increasing tariffs to recover costs isn’t easy either. In India, electricity prices aren’t entirely market driven. State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) set these tariffs, trying to strike a tricky balance, keeping discoms financially alive while ensuring people don’t burn holes in their pockets over power bills. To do this, they rely on cross subsidies. That means industries pay more so that the agricultural sector and households can pay less.</p>
    
          <p>Now, the National Tariff Policy under the Electricity Act, 2003, says that these subsidies can’t stretch beyond ±20% of the average cost of supply (ACoS). But here’s the catch. According to a paper by the Centre for Social and Economic Progress, more than half the power sold in India breaks this rule. The biggest underpayers being domestic and agricultural consumers, who end up paying much less than they ideally should.</p>
    
          <p>And here’s why fixing this is so difficult. A quote from the paper explains it well:</p>
    
          <div class="right-border">
            <p>The general principle of raising tariffs quickly becomes political, more so if this is done disproportionately for one consumer group. Unfortunately, the lowest-priced segments are the ones with the greatest political clout—Residential and Agricultural.
            </p>
            
            <p>How much tariff rise is too much? Much more than inflation is likely to be considered burdensome, but legacy issues including cost structure and demographic differences are also factors in tariff rises. A DisCom with limited (or even nil) tariff hikes in recent years, for whatever reason, needs a large jump.</p>
    
            <p>Any substantial rise needs to be spread out over several years.</p>

          </div>

        <p>In today’s Newsroom, we tell you why Aditya Birla Real Estate has struck a deal with ITC to sell off its pulp and paper business.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>The story</h3>

        <p>Back in the late 19th century, cotton was king. The world couldn’t get enough of it.</p>

        <p>But then came the American Civil War. And just like that, cotton production in the Southern United States, then the world’s biggest cotton supplier, came to a halt. Exports dried up and the rest of the world was left scrambling to find alternatives.</p>

        <p>And out of that demand was born the Century Spinning and Manufacturing Company.</p>

        <p>Fast forward to 1951, the Birlas took over the management of the company. And from there, it was full steam ahead.</p>

        <p>They didn’t just stick to cotton. Over the years, they kept expanding into textiles, chemicals, cement, paper, real estate… you name it.</p>

        <p>But here’s the thing. Running multiple capital heavy businesses isn’t exactly a walk in the park. It’s not just about money. It’s about having the focus, the manpower, execution – all of it.</p>

        <p>And over time, the company realised that doing a lot of things averagely wasn’t as good as doing a few things exceptionally well.</p>

        <p>So they began streamlining. One by one, the non-core businesses were pruned.</p>

        <p>And now all that’s left are two — real estate and paper.</p>

        <p>Oh, and it’s no longer called Century Spinning and Manufacturing Company either.</p>

        <p>Somewhere along the journey, it became Century Textiles and Industries.</p>

        <p>And again, just last year it went through another transformation and got renamed to Aditya Birla Real Estate.</p>

        <p>We’ll just call it ABREL from here on.</p>

        <p>That new name says a lot.</p>

        <p>It signals where the company’s heart is — real estate.</p>

        <p>Which means anything that doesn’t fit that vision has to go.</p>

        <p>Including its paper division.</p>

        <p>So a few days ago, ABREL announced selling off its pulp and paper business, better known as Century Pulp and Paper (CPP), to ITC for about ₹3,500 crores.</p>

        <p>And no, this isn’t one of those overnight decisions.</p>

        <p>In fact, ABREL’s been trying to exit the paper business for nearly a decade.</p>

        <p>Back in 2015, it tried to strike a deal with ITC itself.</p>

        <p>And then again in 2017, there was talk about selling it to JK Paper.</p>

        <p>But nothing materialised because valuation became a sticking point.</p>

        <p>ABREL wanted ₹5,000 crores for the business back then, which was a price tag that potential buyers weren’t too keen to pay.</p>

        <p>But now, ITC’s back at the discussion table.</p>

        <p>And that makes you ask ― What changed in the last ten years?</p>

        <p>And why the heck is ABREL so eager to become a pure play real estate company?</p>

        <p>Well, for starters, let’s not assume CPP is a weak link.</p>

        <p>It actually brings in the big bucks, accounting for over 75% of ABREL’s revenue.</p>

        <p>That’s huge.</p>

        <p>But revenue alone doesn’t tell the whole story.</p>

        <p>Making paper isn’t exactly easy business. It’s not just capital intensive but also relies on delicate raw materials with prices that swing all over the place.</p>

        <p>It all starts with trees. Making paper means you need wood, typically from pine or eucalyptus trees. But Indian wood producers face a massive problem — land. The government only allots about 12 lakh hectares of forest land for pulpwood plantations. That’s just a measly 4% of what’s actually needed. So supply is always tight.</p>

        <p>Then came the pandemic, and things got worse. Tree planting took a hit. And since these trees take 5–6 years to mature, a delay in planting during those years means a delayed harvest now. That has created a shortage. But as supply fell, demand didn’t. Because other industries like furniture, construction and biomass energy were also in the race to grab the same wood. So naturally, prices shot up. Virgin wood became expensive. And recycled paper, the logical alternative, didn’t help either. Its prices more than doubled between FY21 and FY23.</p>

        <p>Even imported pulp wasn’t spared. CPP saw its imported pulp costs go up 17% over the past year. And wood prices were up by 7%.</p>

        <p>But that’s not the end of the list. Indian paper manufacturers also face stiff competition from cheap imports. Thanks to free trade agreements, paper from China and ASEAN members enters India with little to no import duties. That means it’s cheaper than domestically produced paper.</p>

        <p>These countries also heavily subsidise their paper industries. So they can afford to sell at lower prices. And when the US and EU slapped trade restrictions and higher import duties on products from these countries, they had to find new markets. India became the obvious choice. So their surplus paper flooded our market.</p>

        <p><strong>Sidebar:</strong> In September 2024, the Indian Paper Manufacturer Association requested the government for imposition of anti dumping duty on cheap paper imports.</p>

        <p>To keep up, Indian giants like JK Paper had no choice but to increase their prices. That helped them hold onto their healthy EBITDA margins, typically in the range of 20–25% or sometimes even higher.</p>

        <p>But CPP wasn’t as lucky. Even though it made smart moves like using renewable energy and switching to alternative raw materials like bagasse (a residue from sugarcane), its EBITDA margins stayed stuck between 12–17% since FY21. And that’s a tough game when you’re up against competitors with nearly double the margins.</p>

        <p>Here’s something you should know though. Companies like JK Paper and West Coast Paper Mills (another competitor) have the advantage of focus. JK Paper is a complete paper and packaging company. While West Coast makes mostly optic fibre cables alongside paper. But even then, its scale and concentration give it a leg up.</p>

        <p>ABREL, on the other hand, has been trying to balance two very demanding sectors ― paper and real estate. So it had to make a choice. And it chose the one with more promise — real estate!</p>

        <p>Sure, real estate margins aren’t shining right now either. EBITDA margins have fallen from 21.8% in FY21 to just 3.6% in FY24 (and are around 6.2% so far in FY25). But that’s expected. ABREL is in investment mode right now. It’s busy acquiring land, literally laying the groundwork and setting up for the long game. So sales realisation, the real money, will only start kicking in around FY27. And when it does, margins are projected to zoom between 25%-35%, and even up to 45% in premium markets like Mumbai’s Worli.</p>

        <p>In fact, the money from the sale will also help ABREL reduce its debt burden. For context, its consolidated net debt stood at ₹4,300 crores as of 9MFY25. That’s a debt to equity ratio of 1.06 times, which is significantly higher than 0.61x in FY24. And becoming debt free in the real estate business is a rare feat.</p>

        <p>So it’s safe to say that ABREL is letting go of short term gains to build something far bigger in the long run.</p>

        <p><strong>But Newsroom – If the paper business is struggling, why on earth does ITC want it?!</strong></p>

        <p>Well, for ITC, this is more than just a bargain. ITC already has a sizeable paper presence with an annual manufacturing capacity of 8 lakh metric tonnes. But it wants to grow. And CPP, with its 4.8 lakh metric tonnes of installed capacity, fits the bill perfectly. It instantly gives ITC a 60% boost in capacity, without the time, risk or cost of building something from scratch.</p>

        <p>There’s also geography. ITC’s paper facilities are mostly in South India, except for a tissue mill in the North. But CPP’s plant in Lalkuan, Uttarakhand opens up a whole new region for ITC. It’s like unlocking a new market without having to dig the foundations.</p>

        <p>Also, here’s what we haven’t told you yet. The paper industry might be in a bit of a slump right now, but it’s slowly turning the page. Things are beginning to look up.</p>

        <p>India’s FMCG market for instance is said to grow 7% annually till FY27, which means more demand for packaging.</p>

        <p>Then, with single-use plastics banned, paper straws and coffee cups are in.</p>

        <p>Also, the National Education Policy 2020, effective from 2024, could boost rural education and push up demand for textbooks, notebooks and other printed material.</p>

        <p>And let’s not forget the e-commerce boom which is also fuelling demand for kraft (containerboard) paper and boxes. So if you thought digitalisation was going to bury the paper industry, think again.</p>

        <p>And for ITC, the timing couldn’t be better. The paper industry’s current down cycle means that CPP’s valuation is far more reasonable than it was in 2017. ITC is essentially buying at a discount.</p>

        <p>So yeah, it looks like a smart, well timed deal where everyone walks away happy.</p>

        <p>But whether these bets pay off is something we’ll have to wait and see.</p>

        <p>Until then…</p>

          </div>
      </div>

      <div class="col  paragraph">
        
        <p>In today’s Newsroom, we simply break down the Siemens Energy demerger.</p>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>The Story</h3>

        <p>On Wednesday, Siemens India’s stock jumped 4%.</p>

        <p>The reason?</p>

        <p>The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) gave the company the green light to spin off its energy business into a separate entity, Siemens Energy India. Soon, this new company will be listed independently on the stock exchanges.</p>

        <p>And the plan is simple. If you hold one share of Siemens India today, you’ll get one share of Siemens Energy India post demerger. Sounds like a good deal, right?</p>

        <p>After all, more shares mean more potential upside if both companies thrive. But that’s not the only reason Siemens India is splitting its energy business.</p>

        <p>But before we tell you more about that, let’s take a step back and understand Siemens India itself. What it does, how it grew and why it’s such a big deal in the engineering space today.</p>

        <p>You see, back in the 1800s, if you wanted to send a message from one country to another, you had to put it on a ship and wait, sometimes for a whole month. That’s how long it took for news to travel from Britain to India. But in 1870, a German electrical engineer, Werner von Siemens, changed the game. His company built an 11,000 km long telegraph line connecting the two countries. Suddenly, a message that once took weeks could now reach Calcutta (then India’s capital and now Kolkata) from London in just 28 minutes.</p>

        <p>Now we know what you’re thinking. 28 minutes is painfully slow in today’s world of instant messaging and social media. But back then it was nothing short of revolutionary. And it also marked Siemens AG’s very first footprint in India.</p>

        <p>Fast forward to 1922, Siemens officially set up shop in the country. Post independence, the company expanded aggressively, setting up its first manufacturing unit in Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1955. Over time, it diversified, getting into medical equipment, electrical motors and a whole range of industrial technologies.</p>

        <p>Cut to today, Siemens India is a giant, with five key business segments. The biggest is Smart Infrastructure, which contributes to 32% of the revenue and helps manage energy efficiently with smart metres and electricity grid solutions. Then there’s the Energy segment (contributing to 30% of the revenue), which provides power transmission solutions for industries like oil & gas, railways and construction. For example, Siemens bagged an order to electrify the Bengaluru Metro Phase 2 project last year. Next, we have Digital Industries, which makes software and sensors for sectors like manufacturing, auto and pharma. Mobility focuses on technology for trains, metros and railway infrastructure. And finally, the smaller segment that covers other revenue sources like those from healthcare which focuses on developing medical technology like MRI and CT scanners.</p>

        <p>Now all of these segments put together have helped Siemens India generate ₹20,500 crores in revenue in FY24 (ending September, since it follows an October-September financial year like its parent company). That makes it the fifth largest revenue contributor to Siemens AG, contributing about 4% to the group’s topline and the fastest growing one at that.</p>

        <p>But Siemens wants more. With India’s manufacturing boom, the company sees an opportunity to push its Indian operations higher in the ranks. It wants to make it the third or fourth largest revenue contributor for Siemens AG over the next three years. That’s exactly why it’s closely following its parent company’s playbook.</p>

        <p>For context, back in 2020, Siemens AG decided to demerge its global energy business. The idea was simple — allow the energy segment to operate independently without dragging down the broader company’s performance. And in hindsight, it was a smart move. Between 2020 and 2023, Siemens AG racked up €7 billion worth of losses. But after the demerger, Siemens Energy (the global entity) turned things around, posting a profit of €480 million in Q1FY25 or nearly double what it made in the same period in 2024.</p>

        <p>And you could say that Siemens India is hoping for a similar success story.</p>

        <p>The energy business has different growth drivers, capital requirements and risks compared to Siemens India’s other segments. So running it as a separate entity could help unlock value for both the company and its shareholders. And post demerger, the promoters, Siemens AG and Siemens Energy Holdco will continue to own 75% of Siemens Energy India, while public shareholders will hold the remaining 25%.</p>

        <p>And there’s already momentum. The energy segment’s new orders grew 30% YoY in FY24, reaching ₹8,800 crores. Its order backlog jumped by the same percentage to ₹10,050 crores, while revenue grew 5% YoY to ₹6,280 crores. That’s solid progress.</p>

        <p>But, of course, no big change comes without risks.</p>

        <p>One potential concern is working capital pressure. Siemens Energy (global) has seen this firsthand. A note by S&P Global explains that while the company has been generating a positive free cash flow since its 2020 spin off, this has largely been due to advance payments for new equipment orders. With its order backlog ballooning from €80 billion in 2020 to €123 billion in 2024, contract liabilities (or money it has received for work yet to be done) also surged from €10 billion in 2020 to €19 billion in September 2024.</p>

        <p>So yeah, while a growing order backlog might seem like a good thing, it can also put a strain on Siemens Energy India, just like it has for its global counterpart as handling more orders and growing revenue also means that Siemens Energy India might need to spend more on things like raw materials and inventory.</p>

        <p>We’ll only have to wait and see though, how it all pans out.</p>

        <p>Until then…</p>

        <h3>The Story</h3>

        <p>It’s not every day that you see two of India’s largest business groups — Adani and Aditya Birla — eyeing the same opportunity. And yet, both are entering the Indian wires and cables market.</p>

        <p>Now you may ask – what’s exciting about wires?</p>

        <p>Well, it turns out there’s quite a bit. The Indian wires and cables market, which was worth $8.7 billion in 2023, is expected to nearly double to $17 billion by 2032. And that’s thanks to the electrification of just about everything — homes, factories, data centres, EVs, solar farms, you name it. In fact, wires and cables make up nearly 40% of India’s electrical industry.</p>

        <p>So, let’s look at each of the big entries.</p>

        <p>Let’s start with the Aditya Birla Group. Last month, it invested ₹1,800 crore to set up a new cables and wires manufacturing plant in Gujarat — all under its flagship company, UltraTech Cement. But... what’s a cement company doing in the cable business?</p>

        <p>Well, the group has been building a construction ecosystem. It has the flagship UltraTech cement company along with paints (Birla Opus) and now wires and cables. And to tie it all together it has launched Birla Pivot, a B2B e-commerce platform for building materials, which crossed ₹1,000 crore revenue in FY24.</p>

        <p>The idea is to become a one-stop shop for all construction materials. So if you’re a builder, instead of calling ten vendors, you just call one group offering various materials. It’s vertical integration 101, control more of the value chain, reduce costs, and improve margins.</p>

        <p>Let’s now also look at the Adani Group. The group has also launched a new company in the wires and cables space called Praneetha Ecocables Ltd. This is a 50:50 joint venture with its subsidiary Kutch Copper Ltd, which is currently setting up India’s largest greenfield copper refinery in Gujarat.</p>

        <p>And this is important because copper is the lifeblood of cables. By producing it inhouse, the group can get better pricing and reliable supply, and a better presence in the value chain like Birla. It already owns Ambuja Cement and ACC (two of India’s biggest cement firms), and has skin in the game across power, renewables, ports, and infra – all the sectors where wires and cables are essential.</p>

        <p>So, both Adani and Birla are not just entering wires and cables. They’re integrating it into their larger infra playbooks. It’s scaling with synergies. And that brings us to the question - What does this mean for existing players in this industry?</p>

        <p>Well, key companies in this space – Polycab India, KEI Industries, Finolex Cables, Havells India – have had a dream run over the past few years with rising sales. Investors who spotted them early made a killing. But with the giants entering, the market looks spooked and stock prices have taken a hit.</p>

        <p>And the concern isn’t misplaced. After all, big groups come with deep pockets. They can price aggressively, spend on R&D, build scale, buy out smaller rivals. That’s already nudging the market toward formalisation. The organised sector’s share has gone from 66% in FY18 to 68% in FY19 to over 74% in FY24 — and is expected to hit 80% by FY27.</p>

        <p>So there’s opportunity for listed players to grow if they play it smart. They can innovate or move into premium segments, or even compete with the fragmented unorganised sector. And they have the muscle to do it. They have a strong R&D team for developing tech and electrical products. They have been paying dividends, and have seen good returns on equity for years. And with the PLI scheme for white goods and telecom and networking products, local players still have tailwinds to grow. In fact, India still imports a lot of high-spec cables.</p>

        <p>The only flip side is that as the market grows and formalises, existing players may see margin pressure. It’s because giants like Adani and Birla can afford to price aggressively. They can spend more on capex. They can even buy out struggling rivals. And for listed incumbents, that means lower pricing power… at least for a while.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, the bigger picture is that Adani and Birla aren’t just here because wires and cables are the hot new thing. They’re entering because it fits neatly into their larger infrastructure ambitions. In the coming months, we could also expect acquisition announcements by these two conglomerates. For their cement capacity expansions, both players had followed the same playbook. The Birla group has acquired various companies, the latest one being majority stake in The India Cement while Adani Cement went on to take over Ambuja Cements and ACC. And last year in October, it bought a stake in Orient Cement for ₹8,100 crores. We could see the same thing happening in wires and cables.</p>

        <p>So yeah, the listed players will have to fight harder to protect margins. But in the long run, maybe we can see the industry becoming more efficient, better regulated, and more innovation-driven. And how Adani and Birla will be placed in this industry over the coming few years remains to be seen.</p>

        <p>Until then…</p>

      <hr>

      <h3>The story</h3>

      <p>A whopping 275%!</p>

      <p>That’s how much India’s active pickleball player count has shot up in the past three years. If you put a number to it, that’s around 60,000 players by the end of 2024. And if you count the casual ones who’ve picked up a paddle (pickleball racquet) at least once, that number easily crosses 1 lakh.</p>

      <p>Now, five years ago, if someone said pickleball, you’d probably go, “Pickle-what?” But today, you don’t need an introduction.</p>

      <p>Maybe you’ve heard Nikhil Kamath mention it often on his podcast. Or you might have seen celebrity-backed teams battling it out in India’s first and only franchise-based Pickleball League (WPBL) on Sony Sports Network. So you know that it’s a paddle sport played on an open badminton-sized court, a cusp between tennis, table tennis and badminton. And the fact that you already know this is proof that the pickleball buzz is real.</p>

      <p>And it’s not just a fleeting trend. Startups and venture capitalists (VCs) are betting big on it, convinced that pickleball could be India’s next sporting revolution, just like IPL (Indian Premier League) was for cricket.</p>

      <p>But what makes them so sure, you ask?</p>

      <p>Let’s take it from the top.</p>

      <p>You see, about a decade ago, cricket, India’s most beloved sport, bumped into an unexpected challenge ― declining viewership. The Gross Rating Points (GRP), which measure the reach of advertisements, fell from 105 in 2008 to 61 in 2014. That’s nearly a 40% drop! And it wasn’t just ODIs (One Day Internationals) or Test matches losing steam. Even the shorter and more exciting T20s showed early signs of decline. Sure, IPL was thriving, but TV wasn’t the only game in town anymore, and people had more entertainment options vying for their time. This sort of created an avenue for other alternative sports.</p>

      <p>That same year the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) debuted, and it was an instant hit. Nearly 435 million or 1 in 4 Indian viewers tuned in, making it the second most-watched sporting event after the IPL (which by the way had a viewership of 552 million).</p>

      <p>And while this didn’t directly spark pickleball’s rise, it proved that Indians were open to embracing fresh sports.</p>

      <p>But the real boost for pickleball came during the pandemic. Public gyms were out of the question and contact sports weren’t an option. People needed an easy way to stay active. That’s when pickleball took off. Unlike badminton, tennis or squash, which required some kind of training, pickleball was simple to pick up. The rules were basic and anyone from a Gen Alpha kid to a baby boomer retiree could play it.</p>

      <p>That was in fact, always its purpose. For context, pickleball wasn’t born out of serious athletic ambition. Back in 1965, Joel Pritchard, a US congressman, and Bill Bell, a businessman, returned home after a game of golf to find their families bored. They rummaged around for badminton equipment but couldn’t find a full set of racquets. So, they used table tennis paddles and a perforated plastic ball to improvise and come up with their own game. The goal was to create a game that the whole family could play together. And just like that, a new sport was born.</p>

      <p>That also explains why this game gained traction even among Indians during the pandemic. Fast forward to 2022, and India hosted the Bainbridge Cup (named after pickleball’s birthplace), the first international pickleball event in the country. The prize was a staggering $50,000, which was a hefty sum for a non-professional court game!</p>

      <p>And from then on, there was no looking back. Startups and businesses saw the potential and began capitalising on the trend.</p>

      <p>Its appeal and simplicity wasn’t just about people being able to pick up paddles but also about how easy it was for businesses to jump in. To put things in perspective, setting up a pickleball court requires just a fraction of the investment needed for other sports like badminton. While both games need courts of similar dimensions, a pickleball court can be up and running in about ₹3-5 lakhs. That’s less than 30% of the ₹15 lakhs it takes to set up a badminton court. And in cities like Mumbai (home of Indian pickleball) and Bengaluru, where the sport is booming, businesses can recover their investment in just about three months. Factor in other costs, and it might take a little longer, but they could still churn a profit pretty quickly.</p>

      <p>And the growth is real. According to The CapTable, India had approximately 200 operational pickleball courts in early 2024. Today, that number has surged past 1,200, with 3-4 new courts popping up every week in cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Surat. And with the number of active players projected to hit 1 million by 2028 (up by a staggering 1,500%), demand for courts will only skyrocket to 2,500 courts by then.</p>

      <p>But it’s not just about court setups. Ancillary businesses are cashing in too. Manufacturers of paddles, balls, apparel and accessories are flooding online stores. Even equipment rentals are springing up right outside courts, making it easier for newcomers to try the sport without a big upfront investment.</p>

      <p>And this is just the beginning. If India follows the US model, the scope is even bigger. In the US, where pickleball is the fastest-growing sport, it’s not just about selling paddles online or booking courts, there are full-fledged restaurants and cafés built around the game, turning it into a social experience. Tech companies are even stepping in, creating apps that help players find courts, book lessons and organise leagues. And India isn’t far behind.</p>

      <p>So it’s no wonder that entrepreneurs and VCs are taking notice. You might’ve seen Goodland Pickleball, a US based company, bag ₹80 lakhs in equity on Shark Tank at a ₹13 crore valuation. Or Bengaluru’s GoRally raising $750,000 from investors like Udaan’s Sujeet Kumar and Tracxn’s Abhishek Goyal.</p>

      <p>And at this point, you might be thinking, “This sounds like the perfect startup opportunity!” But… Hold that thought because while the opportunity is exciting, there are a couple of roadblocks to consider.</p>

      <p>For starters, breaking into the business might not be as easy down the line.</p>

      <p>Why?</p>

      <p>Because the sport is already thriving in urban cities, and expanding from here won’t be a walk in the park. Take Mumbai, for example. Space is a luxury here, and setting up new courts can be a logistical and financial nightmare. This means that businesses which already own a tennis court or a gym might have the upper hand. They can simply repurpose their space for pickleball, while newcomers looking to start from scratch face a much steeper climb.</p>

      <p>And if you’re thinking, “No problem, I’ll just choose tier 2 cities or build an ancillary business around pickleball instead”, well, that comes with its own risks too. See, there’s a chance that the sport gets premiumised — kind of like golf or tennis. Some groups, especially the elite, might want to keep it exclusive rather than let it go fully mainstream. And if that happens, pickleball could shift from being an accessible, community-driven sport to a high-end experience only a select few can afford. And for businesses banking on mass adoption, that could shrink the market in ways they didn’t expect.</p>

      <p>So yeah, the pickleball opportunity is huge. But if it ends up benefitting only a select group, be it businesses, investors or the elite, its growth could become skewed. And that kind of goes against the very idea of making pickleball a game for everyone, doesn’t it?</p>

      <p>Until next time…</p>

      <p>If you love finance and have a knack for storytelling, this is your chance to join Newsroom.

      <hr>

      <h3>The story</h3>

      <p>When Trump ran his presidential campaign, one big promise he made was to boost the stock markets. He’s always been vocal about it. But reality is painting a different picture. In the last month, US stock indices have plunged 8%, wiping out $4 trillion in market value.</p>

      <p>So, what’s going on?</p>
      
      <p>Well, there are two fascinating theories behind this unexpected dip.</p>
      
      <p>The first is that this could be a well-orchestrated drama by what Trump calls “globalists”.</p>
      
      <p>Now, who exactly are these globalists? No one knows for sure, but Trump might be referring to foreign investors holding massive amounts of US Treasury bonds (bonds issued by the US government). Take China, for instance. The US buys more from China than the other way round, creating a trade deficit. This leaves China with excess US dollars, which it then recycles into US banks by buying Treasury bonds, essentially lending money back to America for safe returns.</p>
      
      <p>But if Trump shrinks this trade deficit, China has fewer dollars to invest in US banks. Less money flowing into banks means lower profits and potentially another banking crisis. And investors sense this risk, so they’re selling stocks before things get worse.</p>
      
      <p>That brings us to the second, and perhaps more crucial theory for today’s story: The Trump administration itself might be allowing the stock market to fall on purpose.</p>
      
      <p>Sounds bizarre, right? After all, a rising stock market usually signals economic strength, something any president would want. But Trump’s strategy might be different because here’s the thing.</p>
      
      <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes that under the Biden administration, economic policies favoured the top 10% of Americans or those wealthy enough to fuel spending and drive consumption. But the bottom 50% haven’t gained much. So while everything might look great on paper, in reality, half of America could still be struggling.</p>
      
      <p>This imbalance paints a misleading picture, and the Trump administration wants to flip that script. And their way of doing it? Create as much economic chaos as possible.</p>
      
      <p>How’s that, you ask?</p>
      
      <p>By shifting the US economy from a consumer-driven economy (the demand-side) to one powered by businesses and investments (the supply-side). The logic behind this is simple. American consumer spending has kept the economy afloat for decades. But this dependence has also led to high debt, dangerous economic bubbles and rising inflation.</p>
      
      <p>Just look at US debt. It’s currently at a staggering $34 trillion. And $7 trillion of that needs refinancing soon at interest rates that recently hit alarming highs of around 4.8%. It’s like refinancing your home loan at peak interest rates, except now, it’s trillions at stake. Not ideal, right? That’s why the US keeps pushing its debt ceiling limits.</p>
      
      <p>That’s exactly why Trump might prefer a falling stock market now. A falling market triggers investor panic, who then pull out of risky stocks and pour money into safer US bonds. More demand for bonds pushes their prices up, which in turn brings their yields or interest rates down. And that’s exactly what Trump wants.</p>
      
      <p>And this seems to be working. To put things in perspective, the 10-year Treasury yield has already dropped from 4.8% in January to 4.25% today. That may be a teeny tiny shift. But when you’re refinancing trillions, even half a percent saves billions of dollars.</p>
      
      <p>But there’s more to the plan. Trump and his economic advisors believe that a controlled slowdown will reset inflated asset prices and pave the way for a healthier recovery.</p>
      
      <p>And that’s where tariffs come into play.</p>
      
      <p>You see, in theory, tariffs drive up inflation. After all, making imports costlier means consumers pay more. But here’s the twist. Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies are spooking investors so much that they’re more worried about a market slowdown than inflation. So, they’re dumping stocks and buying bonds, effectively giving Trump exactly the market reaction he desires. And he knows it. That’s why he keeps tweaking his tariff stance almost every other day.</p>
      
      <p>It’s almost comical when you think about it. But this sums it up perfectly:</p>
      
      <p>But tariffs are just one piece of the puzzle. Another big move is cutting government spending.</p>
      
      <p>As Scott Bessent bluntly put it, and we quote: “There’s going to be a natural adjustment as we move away from public spending… The market and the economy have just become hooked, and we've become addicted to this government spending, and there’s going to be a detox period.”</p>
      
      <p>And this detox includes slashing government jobs, cutting medicare, reducing food assistance and shrinking housing aid. All of this weakens the demand-side of the economy that we spoke of earlier, reducing consumer-driven growth.</p>
      
      <p>On the flip side, Trump wants to boost the supply side with lower corporate taxes and deregulation, hoping businesses will take the lead.</p>
      
      <p>And all of this begs the question – will this complex approach work?</p>
      
      <p>Well, all of these moves fall under what’s called the proverbial ‘kitchen sinking’ — frontloading maximum economic pain now to rebuild a stronger foundation for tomorrow. And Trump’s team seems fully committed to it, pushing tariffs, cutting social programs and rolling out tax breaks for businesses. That explains the market’s fall.</p>
      
      <p>But there’s a catch. A strategy like this could tip the economy into a full-blown recession.</p>
      
      <p>Markets are already on edge. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warns that an ‘America First’ approach is fine, but ‘America alone’ could backfire. Canada is already threatening to cut electricity exports to the US, something that could hurt American consumers.</p>
      
      <p>And recession risks are rising. Prediction market Kalshi now pegs US recession odds at 40% this year. Meanwhile, expectations for multiple rate cuts in 2025 have shot up — exactly what Trump is aiming for.</p>
      
      <p>But Trump’s supporters argue that this is just a strategic short-term pain for long-term gains. Lower interest rates and stronger business investment could help ‘Main Street’ over Wall Street.</p>
      
      <p>But what about everyday Americans?</p>
      
      <p>A crashing stock market can ruin their retirement savings and wealth. And timing is everything. Restructuring an economy isn’t instant. It’s messy, political and can take years. Businesses and consumers plan for the long term. And if this transition drags on, the pain might last longer than Trump anticipates.</p>
      
      <p>For example, Pittsburgh aluminum major Alcoa’s CEO William Oplinger warns that aluminum production decisions span 20 to 40 years. But if tariffs keep shifting, businesses may hesitate to invest in the US.</p>
      
      <p>And it’s not just the critics arguing. Even Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is cautious, saying: “The costs of being cautious are very, very low. The economy's fine. It doesn't need us to do anything, really. And so we can wait, and we should wait.”</p>
      
      <p>But patience isn’t Trump’s style. For him, immediate action and disruption are essential and that’s how he’s shaking the markets now.</p>
      
      <p>Will this gamble pay off or backfire?</p>
      
      <p>The answer in the end is that both sides (the supporters and critics) will face the same reality. It’s just that not everyone sees it yet. But when the full impact kicks in, one group is bound to be upset and furious about it.</p>
      
      <p>Maybe the signs will start showing in the next few days as interest rates shift. And with the upcoming US monetary policy decision, all eyes will be on what happens next.</p>
      
      <p>Until then…</p>

      <p>Indian stock markets are tumbling, and whether you’re a trader or just a bystander, you’ve probably caught the whispers of panic.</p>

      <p>So in today’s Newsroom, we tell you the why behind it and how you still can be hopeful.</p>

      <p>But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.</p>

      <hr>

      <h3>The Story</h3>

      <p>Last year at a gathering, a friend couldn’t stop raving about his stock market gains. The returns seemed way beyond what the Indian markets were typically offering. My first thought? Where’s the money parked? So, I asked. His answer, “All in stocks, mostly in small and midcaps. No fixed income investments, no gold, and barely any cash on hand.” And right then, I had a gut feeling that this story wouldn’t have a happy ending. We were already deep into a bull market, and he was going all in.</p>

      <p>What does this have to do with FIIs, the recent market crash, or even you? We’ll get to that. But first, let’s talk about the markets and the foreign investors pulling the strings.</p>

      <p>Since October last year, Indian stock markets have been slipping. The Sensex and Nifty are down about 15% from their peaks, wiping out lakhs of crores in value. And it’s not just the big stocks, broader markets are feeling the pain too. According to the Economic Times, 321 of the 938 companies in the BSE Smallcap index have dropped over 20% in just one month, while 243 companies now trade at less than half their 52-week highs. Moneycontrol paints a similar picture for the broader NSE 500, where nearly 400 stocks have lost between 20% and 50% of their value.</p>

      <p>One of the biggest culprits behind this sell-off?</p>

      <p>Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) making a run for the exit. In 2025 alone they’ve already yanked out a staggering ₹1.5 lakh crores. Think of the Indian market as a ₹100 pool, with FIIs holding a hefty chunk. When they start pulling their money out, let’s say ₹20, that ₹100 shrinks to ₹80, dragging the market down, unless fresh buyers step in to fill the gap.</p>

      <p>And why are FIIs moving their money out?</p>

      <p>Well, a few things.</p>

      <p>For starters, Indian markets aren’t as attractive anymore. If you were a foreign investor looking for returns, you’d compare India to global markets. In 2024, the US stock market delivered 23% returns. Europe ranged between 7-18%. The Middle East topped at 26%. Even Japan and Hong Kong gave 15-19%. But India, a mere 8%.</p>

      <p>Now, that might make you think, ‘Okay, maybe 2024 was bad. What about 2025?’ But even here, the outlook isn’t great. Markets are already trading at high valuations, leaving little room for growth. As Aswath Damodaran puts it:</p>

      <p class="right-border">The most expensive market in the world is India, and no amount of handwaving about the India story can justify paying 31 times earnings, 3 times revenue and 20 times EBITDA, in the aggregate, for Indian companies.</p>

      <p>This simply means that the upside potential is limited. Plus, India barely makes a dent in the MSCI World Index, which dictates global fund allocations. So, for FIIs, India just isn’t as appealing right now.</p>

      <p>Then you have taxation woes. In most global markets, FIIs pay zero tax on stock market gains. But in India, they’re now subject to a 12.5% tax on equities held for over a year (long-term capital gains or LTCG) and a 20% tax on short-term capital gains (STCG). A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation here will tell you that if an FII invests ₹100 and earns ₹10, they lose ₹1.25 to LTCG or ₹2 to STCG. So why park money in India when they can keep more profits elsewhere?</p>

      <p>And finally, the depreciation of the rupee eats into their returns. Look, when FIIs invest in India, they first convert their dollars to rupees. But over time, the rupee tends to lose value. In 2024 alone, it weakened by about 3% against the dollar. This means that even if an FII earns a solid 12% return in rupee terms, currency depreciation trims it down to around 9% in dollar terms. Factor in taxes, and the real return gets even slimmer.</p>

      <p>Compare that to US Treasury bonds which offer about 4-5% risk-free returns, and you’ll see why many FIIs are choosing to exit. Add to that the recent changes in India’s Futures and Options (F&O) markets, weaker corporate earnings, global tariffs and geopolitical tensions, and you’ve got the perfect recipe for an FII exodus.</p>

      <p>And at this point, you’re probably thinking — If FIIs leaving hurts the market so much, why does the government keep raising taxes on them? Isn’t that a losing game?</p>

      <p>Now, you’re not wrong. Taxes are one of the few levers the government can control unlike market movements or currency fluctuations. Higher taxes boost revenue. But if they push FIIs away, it’s a self-defeating move. No investors, no gains, no tax revenue. That’s why many experts argue slashing capital gains taxes could lure FIIs back.</p>

      <p>But the bigger question here is: Should this FII activity bother retail investors like us?</p>

      <p>Well, yes and no.</p>

      <p>Sure, FII movements impact overall market returns. But FIIs and retail investors operate on different wavelengths.</p>

      <p>FIIs constantly shift money across geographies, chasing the best risk-reward ratios in dollar terms. Retail investors, on the other hand, earn, spend and invest mostly within India. They don’t have to worry about currency fluctuations or rebalance portfolios based on geopolitical risks. And history shows that while FII movements shake up the market in the short term, they don’t dictate long-term returns.</p>

      <p>So, does that mean we should just “buy the dip”?</p>

      <p>Not necessarily.</p>

      <p>Huh, why do you say that, Newsroom?</p>

      <p>Well, because timing the market is nearly impossible, even for seasoned investors. Markets can stay volatile longer than you expect, and blindly jumping in just because prices are down doesn’t always end well.</p>

      <p>So, what’s the best approach, you ask?</p>

      <p>That brings us full circle to my friend and his stock-heavy portfolio. His strategy reminded me of the classic investing tale of Anne Scheiber, a story that’s often ignored because it seems too simple and boring.</p>

      <p>Anne Scheiber started investing in 1920, setting aside small amounts from her modest paycheck. She had no fancy financial degrees, no insider knowledge — just an unshakable belief in long-term investing. She reinvested dividends, stayed frugal and held onto her stocks through every market crash. By the time she passed away in 1995, her initial savings of just $20,000 had grown into a staggering $22 million. Her annual return? Just 14%. Nothing flashy, just steady, disciplined investing over decades.</p>

      <p>And what does this have to do with today’s FII sell-off?</p>

      <p>Everything.</p>

      <p>Because her story highlights a few important lessons for retail investors navigating turbulent markets:</p>

      <p>Keep cash on hand: When markets correct, you need dry powder to buy at lower prices.</p>

      <p>Focus on averaging in: Instead of worrying about market tops and bottoms, keep investing regularly.</p>

      <p>Stick to the plan: Compounding works best over long periods.</p>

      <p>Yes, markets will fall. Even if you follow these lessons, your portfolio won’t always look great. Maybe not even as great as your neighbour’s during a bull run. But if you stick to a patient, systematic approach, you’ll sleep better at night, no matter how wild things get.</p>

      <p>The truth is, this lesson has always been around. The problem though is that people tend to ignore it when markets are booming. They chase high returns, ditch their disciplined approach, leave no cash for dips or worse, even take on leverage. That’s when trouble starts.</p>

      <p>So the real question isn’t whether you should panic because FIIs are exiting. It’s whether you’re prepared for market cycles.</p>

      <p>Are you cautiously optimistic, like Anne? Are you building a portfolio that can weather the storm? That means keeping cash reserves, diversifying wisely, avoiding unnecessary debt, and most importantly, when the next market crash comes, taking a deep breath, saying ‘All Is Well’, and sticking to the plan.</p>

      <p>Until then…</p>

      <div class="col  paragraph">
        
        <p>Hey folks!</p>

        <p>Welcome to week 3 of Newsroom Cracks Crypto.</p>

        <p>If you’ve been following along, we’ve already cracked open the basics of Bitcoin and blockchain in week 1. Then in week 2, we took a ride through the history of money and how Bitcoin could be the next big chapter.</p>

        <p>So now, you’re probably asking, “Alright, but why should I care? Why does crypto or Bitcoin matter anyway?”</p>

        <p>Fair question. Let’s talk about it.</p>

        <p>Imagine a young chap living in a remote Indian village. Let’s call him Gopal. His family earns a living by rearing cattle and selling milk. But banking? That’s a luxury. The nearest bank is miles away, and even if Gopal gets there, there’s another hurdle. He needs to prove his identity and comply with KYC (Know Your Customer) norms to open an account. Think about it. If someone in his village is a daily wage labourer who doesn’t have a fixed address or proper documents to prove where he lives, how would he even go about making something like AADHAAR card?</p>

        <p>Sure, he could get an Introducer — someone who vouches for him. But that’s another layer of red tape. He’d first need to find an Introducer, go through the entire process, get their AADHAAR card and then finally open a bank account.</p>

        <p>Phew! That’s a lot of steps just to access something as basic as banking. And if he doesn't go through those steps? Tough luck. No account. No access to basic financial services.</p>

        <p>But what if he didn’t need a bank at all? What if there was a system where no documents, no middlemen and no bureaucracy stood in his way?</p>

        <p>Enter Bitcoin. Or, for that matter, any cryptocurrency network. They could actually solve the problem we just talked about and, in some cases, might even replace banks entirely. How’s that, you ask?</p>

        <p>Well, if you’ve followed our previous stories in the series, you know that the crypto network runs on blockchain technology which is decentralised. There’s no single entity or person controlling it and no intermediary.</p>

        <p>So all Gopal needs is just an internet connection, and he’s good to go.</p>

        <p>And hey, over 55% of Indians and 60% of the world have internet access today. With that connection, anyone can simply download an app to set up a crypto wallet and they have their own bank. The app will create a public address (like a bank account number), and boom. They can send and receive cryptocurrencies or funds without any bank or payment companies ever getting involved.</p>

        <p>And unlike traditional money transfers, which can come with hefty fees thanks to multiple parties or banks taking their cut, crypto fees work differently. They depend on how busy the network is. More traffic means higher fees, and paying more gets your transaction processed faster. But here’s something interesting. Whether you send ₹10 or ₹10,000, the fee remains the same. This is different from the banking we see today, where banks keep a flat percentage of the transaction amount as fees, making big transfers more expensive.</p>

        <p>At this point, you might stop us and say, “Wait a minute. I just opened a Bitcoin wallet, and the website asked me for all my KYC documents. So what’s this that you’ve been going on and on about?”</p>

        <p>Well, here’s the thing. There are actually two types of crypto wallets. First, there’s custodial wallets. These are the ones you use when you store or buy crypto through a centralised exchange. Think of them like a gatekeeper or custodian for your crypto. The platform holds your crypto for you, and because they’re in charge of your assets, they need to verify your identity through KYC checks. After all, these entities are answerable to their customers and the government if anything goes wrong.</p>

        <p>But the true power of crypto ownership comes with a non-custodial wallet. And that’s the kind that we’re talking about. These are free apps you can download or hardware devices that give you full control. No KYC, no ID proof, nothing. You simply download the app or buy the device, set up your wallet and take full control. Sure, you’ll need to put money into that wallet, and since banks don’t support direct crypto transactions, most people first buy stablecoins like USDT (we’ll tell you more about this in the upcoming editions) using bank money, then use that to buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. It’s a quick two-step process to move from traditional money to the crypto world. But once that’s done, you’re free to send, receive and store your crypto without any middlemen.</p>

        <p>That means you literally become your own bank. And that, folks, is how financial inclusion could really take off with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the future. Gopal sure would be happy. Not all in his village may opt for cryptocurrency but they’ll at least have the option to trade with any person, at any corner of the world which they were earlier deprived of!</p>

        <p>Sounds like financial inclusion on steroids, right?</p>

        <p>But Bitcoin doesn’t stop there.</p>

        <p>It could help solve some of the deeper economic problems we face beyond just financial inclusion.</p>

        <p>Because it sort of mimics the ideas behind Austrian economics. If that sounds new, Austrian economics is a school of thought that economist Carl Menger kicked off in the 19th century. It argued that everything in the economy follows a cause and effect relationship and that you can’t apply a rigid, one size fits all theory to explain economic behaviour.</p>

        <p>Take the labour theory of value, for instance. It was popular a couple of centuries ago and claimed that the value of a good or service depended solely on the labour put into it. So if it took 10 hours to make a clay pot and 10 hours to mine a nugget of gold, both should technically be priced the same.</p>

        <p>If you laughed at that thought, that’s what Austrian economists did too. They said, “Hey, the value of a good or service doesn’t just come from labour. It can depend on circumstances and people’s preferences.” For instance, diamonds are usually far more expensive than water, not just because they’re harder to produce but also because they’re scarce. But think diamonds vs. water when you’re stranded in a desert for a day without water. Would you rather have a diamond or a glass of water? Water wins hands down, no?</p>

        <p>Ideas like these also shaped Austrian economics’ views on money. Like how money should emerge naturally, not be controlled by governments. That’s where Bitcoin fits in.</p>

        <p>On the contrary, traditional money today isn’t backed by anything tangible, like gold. It’s just backed by the government. This means that governments can keep printing more money whenever they need it.</p>

        <p>Take the US, for instance (because well, the dollar is the reserve currency today). For years, the US has been tweaking and increasing its debt ceilings, or the limit on how much it can borrow. But when debt increases just like that or money is printed without any real limits (out of thin air), money’s supply just keeps growing.</p>

        <p>And you know what happens next – inflation! More money chasing the same goods means prices rise. That’s why ₹100 or $100 today won’t buy what it did a decade ago. And that’s why, year after year, you and I keep seeing prices shooting up, and they rarely go back down. Here's proof:</p>

        <p>Bitcoin flips this script.</p>

        <p>It was designed to avoid losing value the way regular money can. To put things in perspective, governments control money, so they can print more of it, which reduces its worth. But Bitcoin isn’t controlled and it has a fixed supply. Only 21 million will ever exist. And because of this, as more people want Bitcoin but the supply stays limited, its value tends to rise. This built-in scarcity without any authoritative say helps Bitcoin resist inflation, unlike traditional currencies that lose value due to central bank policies or excessive money printing.</p>

        <p>Now this is just the economic aspect of it. But think of what bitcoin can do to solve problems beyond money itself.</p>

        <p>It could democratise the way we vote. Yup!</p>

        <p>Right now, voting means using an electronic voting machine (EVM) or if you’re in the US, you can also choose a paper ballot. But this process is slow, super costly and labour-intensive. After elections, EVMs need to be secured and votes painstakingly counted under strict supervision. That’s a massive effort, especially in a country as big as India.</p>

        <p>But imagine if votes were recorded on a blockchain. Just like Bitcoin runs on a public ledger, electoral authorities could develop private blockchains for voting. Once set up, it could work like an app on your phone or any internet connected device. You verify your identity using a government-issued ID (just as your voter ID), cast your vote and that’s it. Once you’re done, no one else can vote on your behalf. Every validating computer (or node) can then count votes in real time, and once verified, votes can’t be changed or tampered with.</p>

        <p>This shrinks elections from days to minutes. It’s fair, transparent and eliminates the need for polling booths and recurring election costs. The best part? No political party can cry foul about rigged elections because votes on a blockchain are unalterable. Models like this have already been tested in the US, where votes were cast in minutes, and the results were certified in 20 minutes!</p>

        <p>And this exact feature of Bitcoin can empower entire communities too.</p>

        <p>Take rural areas struggling with water access to clean water. Instead of waiting on a municipal body to handle supply and maintenance, blockchain-based systems could track and manage water supply directly. So every time someone logs a request, whether it’s for access to water or fixing a leak, it gets recorded on a shared network. And instead of a central authority setting prices and distribution rules, the community decides these through pre-set agreements on the blockchain. Those who maintain the system don’t work for free. They earn digital tokens as rewards. This keeps things running smoothly and even creates local jobs.</p>

        <p>And this isn’t just a theory. A similar model was successfully tested in India, providing clean water to 45,000 people. The blockchain-based system encouraged community participation and even created 440 informal jobs, with 30% of them going to women.</p>

        <p>Cryptocurrencies could also end corruption in public schemes. Right now, money meant for things like infrastructure projects or relief for the poor often gets siphoned off by bureaucrats before it ever reaches those who need it. But with a public blockchain, this could change. Funds could move directly to beneficiaries, wiping out the layers of intermediaries who might take a cut.</p>

        <p>And what about AI? As machines take over more tasks, they’ll need ways to pay for services, whether it’s cloud computing or data. Crypto enables instant, direct transactions between AI agents (software that act independently, making decisions and completing tasks). Think self-driving cars paying for their own charging or AI assistants buying upgrades all with their own cryptos. Wild, right?</p>

        <p>So yeah, all Bitcoin gave us was decentralisation or a system where community agreements and network rules are set in stone and can’t be broken. And with that, the possibilities are endless, many of which we probably haven’t even imagined yet.</p>

        <p>And while these were just a handful of applications beyond economics and money, Bitcoin has a whole universe of possibilities. It’s code, it’s not dictated by anyone and it treats everyone equally. It creates win-win opportunities where

        <p>In the first part of Newsroom Cracks Crypto, we went over the basics of blockchain and Bitcoin.</p>

        <p>Now it’s time to take a step back. In this second story, we tell you about the evolution of money itself. From barter systems and gold to paper money, we’ll see how societies have redefined value and trust over centuries. And where Bitcoin fits into this fascinating journey.</p>

        <p>Ready to roll?</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>The story</h3>

        <p>I was a kid when I first realised that money was more than coins or paper—it was an idea, a construct.</p>

        <p>So it was the late 90s, and ATMs had just begun to pop up across India. For a kid like me, though, money was only as real as the crumpled notes in my mom’s purse. That illusion shattered one day at a park when I wanted an ice cream. My mom checked her wallet and came up empty. But then she pulled out a plastic card and said, “I’ve got your back.” We walked to an ATM, and what I saw next was pure magic…a machine that spat out cash just because my mom punched in a few numbers. "Is there a secret tunnel to the bank?", my mind raced. She smiled and explained the basics.</p>

        <p>But the questions wouldn’t stop swirling in my head: “How does this money thing really work? If it’s so easy to get money, why do we not have more of it? And why can’t everyone have as much as they want?” My mom, amused by my curiosity, told me, “Keep those questions alive, and one day you’ll understand.” Then she dropped a word that stuck with me: “inflation” (or “mehengai” as she called it). It was her way of saying, “There’s more to this money game than meets the eye.”</p>

        <p>So I kept digging. With every question, every new fact, the rabbit hole of money’s mysteries grew deeper. It wasn’t just coins, notes, or ATMs anymore. It was about history, human behaviour, and how societies agreed to trust abstract ideas that held the world together.</p>

        <p>In high school, our economics teacher told us about a fascinating experiment with primates and their introduction to the concept of money. So, chimpanzees, in various studies, were taught to use specific stones as a currency to trade for bananas. And what happened next? They quickly learned to game the system. Some invented “armed robbery”, stealing stones from weaker chimps to secure their bananas. Others figured out that they could exchange favours, including sexual ones, for stones. It was both amusing and unsettling to see how quickly they mimicked human behaviour, using money as a tool for power and exchange.</p>

        <p>The point here?</p>

        <p>Money isn’t just coins or bills but an abstract form of communication, a way for humans to agree on and exchange value. Think of it as the glue that holds civilisations together. And that’s probably why money is fundamentally a social construct — because it relies on shared trust. At its most basic level, money helps us exchange things we agree have equal worth, creating the social bonds that make trade, cooperation, and even societies possible.</p>

        <p>So it’s no surprise that when I think about Bitcoin today, I’m amazed at how far we’ve come in redefining money.</p>

        <p>But to understand its significance, we need to rewind to where it all began. To the very roots of value, trust and exchange. Let’s jump in…</p>

        <h3>Barter</h3>

        <p>Now money, in its earliest form, was about survival. Imagine a time when barter was the way to trade. Apples for fish, wheat for milk. On paper, it sounds simple, but it had a glaring flaw. Economists call it the "double coincidence of wants”—you had to want exactly what the other person was offering, and vice versa. If a farmer wants fish, but the fisherman doesn’t need wheat, the trade collapses right there. And even when the trade worked, goods like cows or sacks of grain were bulky, perishable, and often indivisible. What if you only needed half a cow? Tricky, no? All this made barter messy and limited trade to local exchanges.</p>

        <p>So humanity moved on to...</p>

        <h3>Collectibles</h3>

        <p>Shells, beads, feathers and even stones. And it was here when money became an abstraction for the first time. How? It wasn’t about something you could eat or directly use, but about something people agreed had value. In that sense, this was revolutionary, the first major technological leap in the story of money.</p>

        <p>These collectibles were durable, divisible and portable, making trade easier than ever before. But there was a catch: abundance. If anyone could find or make more of these items, their value would just collapse. They couldn’t hold value over time. Plus, it was also difficult to trade outside of established communities because each of them had a different collectible of their own which they termed as money.</p>

        <p>So, the search for something scarcer and uniform led humanity to...</p>

        <h3>Gold</h3>

        <p>And you’ve to hold on to your seats, because this is one of the most popular abstractions that money saw at a larger level – to use precious metals to express value.</p>

        <p>Gold checked all the boxes. Shiny and durable, easy to divide and transport (at least when compared to a rock), and most importantly, scarce. Its universal use as jewellery added intrinsic value, and its adoption by powerful rulers through taxation gave it legitimacy. Gold became the first universally accepted form of money, enabling trade across nations and creating unprecedented wealth.</p>

        <p>So yeah, two big revolutions for money. And then nothing happens for hundreds of years.</p>

        <p>But as trade and globalisation grew, societies realised that gold wasn’t perfect. Imagine trying to carry enough gold coins to buy a ship. Impractical, yes?</p>

        <p>So humankind came up with a brilliant idea then – if we can deposit this gold with someone trustworthy, they can give us a promise note saying we have this gold in this trustworthy vault. We can then trade this paper instead of gold!!! It would solve a ton of our problems.</p>

        <p>And that idea led to the invention of – you guessed it...</p>

        <h3>Paper Money</h3>

        <p>Paper Money</p>

        <p>You think people are freaking out about cryptocurrencies today? Think how much they must have been terrified about paper money! </p>

        <p>It was unfathomable for many because well, the paper didn’t have any value. It was nothing that they had imagined as money before. And it took hundreds of years before paper money became globally acceptable</p>

        <p>Now, initially, paper notes were backed by gold reserves. You could exchange them for a fixed amount of gold. </p>

        <p>So each note was essentially a promise that it could be exchanged for a specific amount of gold stored in central bank vaults. This system gave people trust in paper money, as it was directly tied to something tangible and scarce. Central banks would print money only equivalent to the gold they held, ensuring stability. This principle was officially established during the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944, which pegged global currencies to the US dollar, itself tied to gold. </p>

        <p>Thus it created a system where the trust in paper money was intrinsically linked to the gold reserves backing it. But this wasn’t just an economic strategy; it was a psychological one. The connection to gold made people believe in the value of the notes, anchoring the abstract concept of money to something real.</p>

        <p>However, the abandonment of the gold standard marked a seismic shift in the story of money. It led us to what we today call...</p>

        <h3>Fiat Money</h3>

        <p>You see, in 1971, under US President Richard Nixon, the US decoupled the dollar from gold entirely. This decision, driven by rising deficits from the Vietnam War and domestic spending, was meant to stabilise the economy but had far-reaching consequences.</p>

        <p>Governments could now print money freely. And this eroded the natural checks that gold once imposed. The shift fundamentally altered the dynamics of money, transforming it into a tool of policy rather than a store of value, and set the stage for the financial instabilities like soaring inflation, mounting national debts and inequities we grapple with today.</p>

        <p>The removal of the gold standard was a turning point in monetary history. It was then when the US dollar emerged as the world’s reserve currency, largely because of America’s post-World War II economic dominance. And even when the US unilaterally ended this system in 1971, the dollar’s dominance remained.</p>

        <p>Why? Trust. Despite its flaws, the dollar was backed by the strength of the US economy. It became a new kind of social contract.</p>

        <p>And then, as the financial system grew, so did the layers of money as a form of abstraction.</p>

        <p>Just that way a few decades ago, we saw a new form of money in the form of plastic cards. In fact, the first cards such as the US Diners Club cards were actually paper or cardboard, which were a form of traveller’s cheques. And in case you aren’t familiar with that term, a traveller’s cheque is a type of pre-printed paper currency that you can use instead of cash while travelling. It’s safer than carrying a lot of cash because if you lose it or it gets stolen, you can get a replacement.</p>

        <p>And as we progressed, with credit cards, digital banking and now UPI payments, money became more intangible. Most of the money in the world today exists only as numbers on a screen. It’s a breakthrough and it keeps you in wonder.</p>

        <p>Yet, for all its innovation, this system is riddled with huge problems.</p>

        <p>That’s because banks don’t operate on a one-to-one reserve system. Instead, they practice something called fractional-reserve banking or a system where they lend out more money than they actually hold.</p>

        <p>For instance, if you deposit ₹100, the bank might keep only ₹10 in reserve and lend out the remaining ₹90. And it doesn’t stop there. Banks also borrow from one another, creating a web of interbank lending that fuels even more debt. This domino effect means that if too many people try to withdraw their money at once, it could trigger a scenario known as “a bank run” and the system can collapse.</p>

        <p>And let me tell you that history is littered with such examples, from the Great Depression in the US to more recent crises in countries like Greece, where citizens lined up at ATMs only to find their accounts frozen or empty. It’s a stark reminder that the money you see on your screen might not actually exist when you need it the most.</p>

        <p>So yeah, to say the least, it’s a fragile system prone to collapse. And apart from banks, we have governments manipulate interest rates and print money to solve short-term crises, often at the expense of long-term stability.</p>

        <p>The result?</p>

        <p>A system that's riddled with problems: centralised control, inflation and inequality.</p>

        <h3>Enter Bitcoin!</h3>

        <p>In 2008, an idea called Bitcoin was born and a year later, in 2009, the first bitcoin transaction happened (something called a genesis block on the network). And that’s when the revolutionary journey truly began. It wasn’t just about creating digital money but a complete reinvention of the concept of money itself.</p>

        <p>It’s entirely abstract. Forget the shiny gold coins that represent it with a “B” you see in pictures. Bitcoin is formless and shapeless or rather, just mathematical code. You can even hide it in a painting or write it down on paper. This makes it very different and special. And this abstraction is what makes it revolutionary.</p>

        <p>No governments. No banks. No middlemen. Just pure code.</p>

        <p>So obviously, when I first heard about Bitcoin, I couldn’t wrap my head around it. It was nothing like the money I knew. And so I started comparing it to the characteristics of traditional money and here’s how it went…</p>

        <p>Like gold, bitcoin is scarce — only 21 million will ever exist. It’s durable too to an extent as it’s going to be around as long as we have the internet and a decentralised, incentivised network to back it. It’s more portable and divisible than any other form of money we’ve known. But unlike gold, its value isn’t physical. It’s in its network. Every transaction strengthens its dominance and adoption.</p>

        <p>And the game-changer? No one can freeze or seize your bitcoin if you hold the private keys yourself. That’s because it’s not controlled by any single authority. Instead, it’s powered by a network of users and computers working together to keep things running smoothly.</p>

        <p>So here’s the thumb rule, and the only rule with Bitcoin ownership: Your private keys, your bitcoin!!</p>

        <p>(Private keys are like secret passwords that let you access and control your bitcoin. They’re long strings of numbers and letters—usually 64 characters—that keep your bitcoin safe. Without them, no one, not even you, can access your bitcoin.)</p>

        <p>This makes it a big deal for financial freedom, especially in authoritarian regimes or during economic crises.</p>

        <p>To understand this, let’s think about how money evolved. For centuries, and especially with the invention of modern money, hierarchical institutions like rulers, banks, governments, and other gatekeepers decided how money was used. They held the keys to your actions. Want to send some funds overseas? You’ll need a bank’s approval to accept or deny that request.</p>

        <p>Then came the internet, which brought us apps and online services. But even these platforms have gatekeepers.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin changed that. Because Bitcoin isn’t a platform, it’s a protocol. You see, platforms need middlemen to work. But protocols like Bitcoin let people deal with each other directly (peer-to-peer interactions). Thus it eliminates the need for gatekeepers.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin’s creator, who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto, remains a mystery. But that’s part of its genius. It’s more of a feature than a bug. Why? Well, you can see all of Bitcoin transactions, thanks to its transparent system. But you’ll never know who made those transactions. Because Bitcoin is pseudonymous—that is, its addresses don’t reveal personal identities, unlike bank accounts.</p>

        <p>So yeah, Bitcoin is different. Because protocols don’t need sign-ups or permissions. Just code and math.</p>

        <p>When you buy bitcoin, you’re getting access to digital units stored on a decentralised ledger, secured by a public and private key system. Move it off a crypto exchange to a cold wallet (a device or a paper) or even write down your private key, and it’s all under your control.</p>

        <p>It’s a system where nodes and participants work together under the same consensus rules. Every participant is equal. No one person or entity controls it.</p>

        <p>So essentially, Bitcoin is the first widely adopted, network-centric, protocol-based form of money. Think of it like a universal language for money, opening up endless possibilities. Gold is durable but hard to carry. Paper money is easy to carry but not rare. Fiat money struggles with trust and censorship. Bitcoin scores high across the board.</p>

        <p>Its major weakness? It’s young. But with each transaction, it gains legitimacy. All these years, it has survived countless attacks from hackers and governments, yet it goes on to shine brighter with every blow. It’s what they call antifragile—it thrives under pressure.</p>

        <p>Sure, we could argue that it is a bubble or too volatile to be money. Maybe. But remember, money has always gone through chaotic changes before becoming stable as you just saw earlier. And volatility could also be a feature of its early stage of adoption, yeah? As more people and institutions adopt this technology, who knows, its price might just stabilise.</p>

        <p>So Bitcoin is a simple line of code, but it holds the potential to change how we think about trust, value, and freedom.</p>

        <p>Yes, it terrifies a lot. A transformation this fundamental always does.</p>

        <p>But as the expression in the US goes, “Possession is nine-tenths of the law”. Well, in bitcoin possession is tenth-tenths of the law. There is no debt. No fake money.</p>

        <p>In Bitcoin, possession of private keys is the ultimate proof of ownership, unlike traditional systems where intermediaries often control access to your funds.</p>

        <p>If you hold your private keys, your bitcoin is yours. If you don’t, it’s not.</p>

        <p>Internet changed many industries with just a few lines of Python code. That’s possibly what’s happening to money with the invention of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.</p>

        <p>It’s one mathematical formula (and the only currency with a mathematical formula) that’s changing industries, nations, and how we think about value. And it may very well be years or decades from now that the world understands and accepts this.</p>

        <p>We’ll end this long story on that note.</p>

        <p>And in the next one, we’ll explore how Bitcoin goes beyond money—challenging economic systems and even sparking questions about its role in a world run by AI. Stay tuned!</p>

        <p>Until next time…</p>
